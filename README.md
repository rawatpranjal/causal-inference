# Causal Machine Learning

- Deep Learning for Individual Heterogenity and Inference from Farrell et al., (2021)
    - Linear, logit Models under unconfoundedness
    - Code adapted from https://github.com/MisraLab/cml.github.io
- Double Machine Learning (DML) from Chernozhukhov et al., (2016)
    - Estimation under unconfoundedness and instruments
    - Examples
- Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) and Probabilitic Graphical Models (PGMs)
