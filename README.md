# Causal Machine Learning

Causal Inference through Machine Learning Methods:
- Deep Learning for Individual Heterogenity and Inference from Farrell et al., (2021)
    - Linear, logit Models under unconfoundedness
- Double Machine Learning (DML) from Chernozhukhov et al., (2016)
    - Estimation under unconfoundedness
    - Estimation with instruments
- Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) and Probabilitic Graphical Models (PGMs)
